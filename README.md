Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
This is a flight booking website , built with Next.js that showcases my coding skills.


Live Demo : 

Flight flow consists of three-levels

First Level: A form that searches for flights

Second Level: Page that lists flight options depending on the search value

Third Level: Payment page, shows all details of the flight and total amount to pay. Payments are possible only if authenticated so , there is a backend running to login and register as well.



ðŸ”­Currently working on connecting other providers to login , flight filtering options, payment page and error validations

this test app can only search for these flights:

"Dubai - Bahrain"
"London - Moscow"



First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
