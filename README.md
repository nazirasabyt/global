Hi there ðŸ‘‹,
This is a coding test for a flight booking website , built with Next.js that offers connection to Metamask.

Live Demo : 

Flight flow consists of three-levels

First Level: Flight Form page to fill in all data about the required flight (origin "city(airport code)" - destination "city (airport code)" - departure date - return date - passenger count )

Second Level: flight list with different options

Third Level: payment page, Shows all details of the flights and total amount to pay

Its a quick fix without much of error handling.
ðŸ”­Currently working on connecting other providers to login ,flitering options payment page and error validations

this test app can only search for these flights:

Dubai - Bahrain
London - Moscow



First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
